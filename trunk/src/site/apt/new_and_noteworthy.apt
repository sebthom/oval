    disabled during runtime

    @MaxSize, @Min, @MinLength, @MinSize, @Past>>>
    
  * validating/guarding of static fields and methods is now supported
  
  * introduced the concept of constraint profiles

  * added <<<Guard.setExceptionTranslator()>>> allowing you to change the type of 
    exception that is thrown on constraint violations

** Migration Notes (0.8 to 0.9)

  In the attempt to add all the new features and to make OVal 1.0 release ready, 
  a large part of OVal's code base has been refactored. 

  This led to certain changes in the API:

  * Packages with names in plural have been changed to singular
    (e.g. net.sf.oval.constraints => net.sf.oval.constraint)
    
  * Everything related to programming by contract has been moved into a new 
    package called net.sf.oval.guard. This includes ConstraintsViolatedListener,
    GuardAspect, Guard, @PreValidateThis, @PostValidateThis and others.
    
  * The Guard class now extends the Validator class, therefore the 
    Guard.getValidator() method has been removed.
   
  * For class invariants are now checked by default for guarded classes on every
    call to non-private methods. If you require the old behaviour you can disable 
    automatic invariant checking via 
    <<<MyGuardAspect.aspectOf().getGuard().setInvariantCheckingActivated(false)>>>
    
  * Getter methods now need to be annotated with @IsInvariant if their return
    value should be checked on a object validation via 
    <<<Validator.validate(Object)>>>
    
  * The Guard's setReportingMode() methods have been replaced with 
    setInProbeMode methods.
    
    
* OVal 0.1alpha (2005-08-17)
