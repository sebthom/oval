Roadmap

 We currently do not have a fixed roadmap for the next releases of OVal, 
 however there are several features we would like to implement over the next time:
 
  * support for constraints specified for method parameters at interface level
  
  * support for inherited constraints
  
  * Spring 2.0 XSD configuration support
  
  * implement JSR303 {{http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=303}}
  
  * provide tighter integration with web-app frameworks (JSF, Struts, Wicket etc)
