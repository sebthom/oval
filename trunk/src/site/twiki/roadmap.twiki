---+ Roadmap

We currently do not have a fixed roadmap for the next releases of OVal, 
however there are several features we would like to implement over the next time:
   * support for constraints specified for method parameters at interface level
   * support for inherited constraints
   * Spring 2.0 XSD configuration support
   * implement JSR303 http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=303
   * provide tighter integration with web-app frameworks (JSF, Struts, Wicket etc)
