OVal 0.9
========

New features:
-------------
+ Scripting Support (Groovy, JavaScript, BeanShell) for class invariants, Pre- and Postconditions (@Assert, @Pre, @Post)
+ Automatic check of class invariants on calls to all non-private methods
+ Check of class invariants, pre-, postconditions can be separately enabled or disabled during runtime
+ New constraints (@CheckWith, @Future, @HasSubstring, @Max, @MaxLength, @MaxSize, @Min, @MinLength, @MinSize, @Past)
+ validating/guarding of static fields and methods is now supported
+ introduced the concept of constraint profiles
+ added Guard.setExceptionTranslator() allowing you to change the type of exception that is thrown on constraint violations

Migration Notes:
----------------
In the effort to add all the new features and to make OVal 1.0 release ready, 
a large part of OVal's code base has been refactored. 

This led to certain changes in the API:

a) Packages with names in plural have been renamed to names in singular
   (e.g. net.sf.oval.constraints => net.sf.oval.constraint)
b) Everything related to programming by contract has been moved into
   a new package called net.sf.oval.guard. This includes: ConstraintsViolatedListener,
   GuardAspect, Guard, ParameterNameResolver, @PreValidateThis, @PostValidateThis
c) The Guard class now extends the Validator class, therefore the Guard.getValidator() method
   has been removed.
d) For class invariants are now checked by default for guarded classes on every call to
   non-private methods. If you require the old behaviour you can disable automatic
   invariant checking via MyGuardAspect.aspectOf().getGuard().setInvariantCheckingActivated(false)
e) the Guard's setReportingMode() methods have been replaced with setInProbeMode methods.
