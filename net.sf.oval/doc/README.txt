OVal - the object validation framework for Java 5 or later
Version $VERSION$
http://oval.sf.net

OVal is a pragmatic and extensible validation framework for any kind of Java
objects (not only JavaBeans). Constraints can be configured with annotations,
POJOs or XML. Custom constraints can be expressed in pure Java or by using
scripting languages such as JavaScript, Groovy, BeanShell, OGNL or MVEL. 
Besides simple object validation OVal implements Programming by Contract
features by utilizing AspectJ based aspects.
