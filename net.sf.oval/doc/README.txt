OVal - object validation framework
Version $VERSION$
http://oval.sf.net

OVal is a generic Java 5 based object validation framework for any kind 
of Java objects (not only JavaBeans). Constraints can be expressed with
annotations or in XML. OVal supports validation of class fields, method
return values, as well as constructor/method parameters. Automatic 
validation (programming by contract) can be achieved by using pre-built
AspectJ aspects.
