Version $VERSION$
http://oval.sf.net

OVal is a generic Java 5 based object validation framework that uses 
annotations to express constraints and optionally AspectJ to handle 
automatic validation (programming by contract). It supports validation
of class fields, method return values, as well as constructor and method 
parameters.
