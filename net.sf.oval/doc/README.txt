OVal - the object validation framework for Java 5 or later
Version $VERSION$
http://oval.sf.net

OVal is a pragmatic and extensible validation framework for any kind of Java
objects (not only JavaBeans). Constraints can be configured with annotations,
POJOs or XML. Custom constraints can be expressed in pure Java or by using
scripting languages such as JavaScript, Groovy or BeanShell. Besides simple
object validation OVal provides certain Programming by Contract features.
They can easily be enable by using the provided AspectJ aspects.
