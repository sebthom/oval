### Changed

  this means the same message resolver instance is used with all Validator/Guard instances.
* Class `net.sf.oval.collection.CollectionFactoryHolder` has been moved to package `net.sf.oval.internal`.
  This class should not be used directly, the collection factory in use can be retrieved via
  the static method `Validator.getCollectionFactory` and set with the static method `Validator.setCollectionFactory`.
* `@Guarded.applyFieldConstraintsToSetter` has been renamed to `@Guarded.applyFieldConstraintsToSetters`
* JPAAnnotationsConfigurer constraint mappings extended:\
  `@javax.persistence.OneToOne  => @net.sf.oval.constraints.AssertValid\
  @javax.persistence.OneToMany => @net.sf.oval.constraints.AssertValid\
  @javax.persistence.ManyToOne => @net.sf.oval.constraints.AssertValid`


## [0.9] - 2007-03-18

### Added
* Scripting Support (Groovy, JavaScript, BeanShell) for class invariants, Pre- and Postconditions (`@Assert, @Pre, @Post`)
* Automatic check of class invariants on calls to all non-private methods
* Check of class invariants, pre-, postconditions can be separately enabled or disabled during runtime
* New constraints: `@CheckWith, @Future, @HasSubstring, @Max, @MaxLength, @MaxSize, @Min, @MinLength, @MinSize, @Past`
* validating/guarding of static fields and methods is now supported
* introduced the concept of constraint profiles
* added `Guard.setExceptionTranslator()` allowing you to change the type of exception that is thrown on constraint violations

### Changed
* Packages with names in plural have been changed to singular (e.g. net.sf.oval.constraints => net.sf.oval.constraint)
* Everything related to programming by contract has been moved into a new
  package called net.sf.oval.guard. This includes ConstraintsViolatedListener,
  GuardAspect, Guard, @PreValidateThis, @PostValidateThis and others.
* The Guard class now extends the Validator class, therefore the Guard.getValidator() method has been removed.
* For class invariants are now checked by default for guarded classes on every
  call to non-private methods. If you require the old behaviour you can disable
  automatic invariant checking via `MyGuardAspect.aspectOf().getGuard().setInvariantCheckingActivated(false)`
* Getter methods now need to be annotated with @IsInvariant if their return
  value should be checked on a object validation via `Validator.validate(Object)`
* The Guard's setReportingMode() methods have been replaced with setInProbeMode methods.


## [0.8] - 2006-12-10

### Added
* JPAAnnotationsConfigurer to translate EJB3 JPA annotations into OVal constraints:
  ```
  @javax.persistence.Basic(optional=false)      => @net.sf.oval.constraints.NotNull

  @javax.persistence.ManyToOne(optional=false)  => @net.sf.oval.constraints.NotNull
  @javax.persistence.Column(nullable=false)     => @net.sf.oval.constraints.NotNull
  @javax.persistence.Column(length=5)           => @net.sf.oval.constraints.Length
  ```

* net.sf.oval.configuration.POJOConfigurer and all configuration elements are now serializable
* added support for ParaNamer http://paranamer.codehaus.org/ for method parameter name resolving

* when @AssertValid is used on a collection the collection's elements are now validated too by default (thanks to tahura)

### Fixed
* AssertConstraintSet constraint was ignored when specified for getter methods' return value
* NPE was thrown when validating objects against an XML based configuration that uses constraint sets
* various fixes regarding XML based configuration (thanks to tahura)

### Changed
* net.sf.oval.annotations.Guarded: annotation @Constrained renamed to @Guarded

* removed the "check" property from the net.sf.oval.ConstraintViolation class


## [0.6] - 2006-08-04

### Added
* constraints programmatically specified during runtime via net.sf.oval.Validator.addCheck(...) can now be removed using net.sf.oval.Validator.removeCheck(...)
* added french translation for the violation messages of the built-in constraints (provided by mimil)
* added @InstanceOf constraint
* simplified annotation check loading by introducing a check parameter to the @Constraint annotation that is used to specify the constraint check class
* made the code to resolve the variables names of constructor and method parameters configurable via the ParameterNameResolver interface and the Validator.setParameterNameResolver(...) method
* added @AssertValid constraint
* introduced an ignoreIfNull parameter for the @ValidateWithMethod annotation

### Changed
* refactored AspectJ related code into separate classes in the package net.sf.oval.aspectj to potentially support other AOP libraries later
* moved @FieldConstraints from package net.sf.oval.annotations to net.sf.oval.constraints
* @FieldConstraints constraint now also considers constraints added to fields during runtime via Validator.addCheck(...)
* changed all static methods of Validator and ConstraintsEnforcer to non-static to allow multiple validator instances at the same time being configured differently

## [0.5] - 2006-04-27

### Added
* added net.sf.oval.ConstraintViolation which now holds the information of a single constraint violation
* using @net.sf.oval.annotations.FieldConstraints you can now apply constraints defined for fields to any constructor/method parameter or getter method in the same class
* added support for localizable error messages
* added support for parameters in constraint violation messages
* net.sf.oval.context.ConstructorParameterContext: added method getParameterName()
* net.sf.oval.context.MethodParameterContext: added method getParameterName()
* the way how the corresponding checks for constraint annotations are resolved/loaded has been made customizable via net.sf.oval.Validator.setAnnotationCheckLoader(AnnotationCheckLoader)
* constraints can now be specified programmatically during runtime via net.sf.oval.Validator.addCheck(...) -> this allows you to implement alternative configuration mechanisms
* added the aspect ApiUsageAuditor that will report warnings about unsupported usage of annotations in Eclipse IDE
* added support for specifying constraints on method return values when using programming by contract (post condition)

### Fixed
* net.sf.oval.Validator: Validation of inherited classes throws NullPointerException [net.sf Issue 1461805]

### Changed
* net.sf.oval.exceptions.ConstraintViolationsException: now holds an array of ConstraintViolations
* net.sf.oval.annotations.Validatable: default value for applyFieldConstraintsToSetter() changed from "true" to "false"
* net.sf.oval.Validator: method validate(Object) now returns List<ConstraintViolation> instead of ArrayList<ConstraintViolationException>

### Fixed
* net.sf.oval.constraints.AbstractCheck: the message specified in constraint annotations was not used in the ConstraintException [sf.net Issue 1449558]
* net.sf.oval.ValidationAspect: OVal tried to validate inner classes not having the @Validatable annotation which resulted in net.sf.oval.exceptions.ValidatableAnnotationNotPresent

### Changed
* net.sf.oval.ValidationAspect: cleaned up and optimized for performance
* net.sf.oval.Validator: cleaned up and optimized for performance
* net.sf.oval.Validator: the removeListener methods now return a boolean value specifying if the listener was registered with the validator

  => constraints specified for fields are now automatically applied to the value parameter of the corresponding setter method
* net.sf.oval.test.SetterValidationWithFieldConstraintsTest
* net.sf.oval.constraints.NotNegative

### Changed
* net.sf.oval.constraints.Check: renamed method isValid to isSatisfied
