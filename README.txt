OVal - the object validation framework for Java 5 or later
Version $VERSION$
http://oval.sf.net

OVal is a pragmatic and extensible validation framework for any kind of Java
objects (not only JavaBeans). Constraints can be declared with annotations 
(@NotNull, @MaxLength), POJOs or XML. Custom constraints can be expressed as 
custom Java classes or by using scripting languages such as JavaScript, Groovy,
BeanShell, OGNL or MVEL. Besides field/property validation OVal implements 
Programming by Contract features by utilizing AspectJ based aspects. This for
example allows runtime validation of method arguments.
